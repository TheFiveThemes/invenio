##Development of the theme:

Development is done in this github repo. If you find a bug or want to make a request for a feature, you can create an issue, or make a pull request of your patch to the theme. Eventually the theme page on The Five Themes website will display the contributors to each theme.

To compile the theme's Sass, there are two options:
- Use Grunt, all you have to do is a quick `npm install` on the project root in terminal, and then just run `grunt` to start watching for changes to the Sass files. 
- Uee [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/), there's a config file included.
